The second goal is to show how empires, nation-states, and international institutions have managed the tension between global economic integration and local political autonomy in different ways. We will discuss a series of key moments in the history of global capitalism in relation to transformations and crises of democracy, beginning in the era of High Imperialism in the 1870s-1880s; then moving to the populism of the 1890s; the interwar crisis of democracy beginning with World War I in 1914 through to the Great Depression and World War II; the post-WWII years, ending in the stagflation and oil crises of the 1970s; and the last four decades of economic globalization, from the debt crisis of the 1980s to the shocks of the 1990s and 2000s which form the precursor to the current turmoil.

The second addresses how and why we might study these processes ethnographically. Here we will consider the potential and limitations of multi-sited and global ethnography, and question the possibility of an activist ethnography of global interconnection.

This course brings together the history of capitalism with the political history of democracy. Its first aim is to show how the ongoing material and technical integration of the globe is both an enabling condition of mass democracy and a constraint on it. The second goal is to show how empires, nation-states, and international institutions have managed the tension between global economic integration and local political autonomy in different ways. We will discuss a series of key moments in the history of global capitalism in relation to transformations and crises of democracy, beginning in the era of High Imperialism in the 1870s-1880s; then moving to the populism of the 1890s; the interwar crisis of democracy beginning with World War I in 1914 through to the Great Depression and World War II; the post-WWII years, ending in the stagflation and oil crises of the 1970s; and the last four decades of economic globalization, from the debt crisis of the 1980s to the shocks of the 1990s and 2000s which form the precursor to the current turmoil. A second line of inquiry is to get a better grip on the analytical traditions that have grappled with and responded to these recurring crises, from different Marxist approaches and world systems theory to Polanyian political economy, neoliberalism, new institutional economics, Keynesianism, macro-finance and Minsky, and a variety of sociological paradigms from Weber and Habermas to Wolfgang Streeck and Ulrich Beck.","title":"Economic Globalization and Democratic Crisis, 1870-present"},"Dpm0ANUItkF1wrhKq2lv":{"offered":"Fall.","descr":"Gives a thorough grounding in basic speaking, listening, reading and writing skills.","title":"Elementary Indonesian I","code":"INDO 1121","label":"INDO 1121: Elementary Indonesian I","credits":4},"DqENPAmHiZCR9Wr4OyWY":{"title":"Individual Instruction","code":"MUSIC 4501","label":"MUSIC 4501: Individual Instruction","credits":3,"descr":"Individual instruction in voice, organ, harpsichord, piano and fortepiano, violin, viola, cello, percussion, and some brass and woodwind instruments to those students advanced enough to do college-level work in these instruments. For more information about individual instruction, see the section titled Musical Instruction.","offered":"Fall, Spring."},"DqVTsPCUIctiJPSgAnk8":{"label":"SPAN 4600: Techno Ghosts, Social Movements, and Archives in Motion","credits":4,"descr":"This course explores how the digital has shaped narratives of memory in contemporary Latin America.

World War I had delivered Europe's old monarchies and autocracies a fatal blow. Three massive continental empires had fallen apart, making way to parliamentary democracies everywhere from Germany to Poland and the Balkans. Yet by the 1930s, few of these democracies were still standing. In the east, a new political experiment had culminated in the rise of a Soviet Empire. In Germany, the democratic elections of 1933 enabled Hitler's rise to power and the growth of a regime unlike anything anyone had ever seen before. In Italy, Mussolini stamped parliamentary democracy under his foot, proclaiming the victory of totalitarianism. A variety of authoritarian regimes arose in between these extremes. They formed alliances and battled each other: at first in the Spanish Civil War and then in World War II. In this seminar, we will closely examine the rise and fall of democracies and anti-democratic regimes in Europe between the two world wars, in order to understand how democracy and authoritarianism are related and what kinds of challenges democracies have faced - both in the past and at present.","offered":"Fall.","title":"The Death of Democracy: Europe Between the World Wars"},"JhqpibqSJHcvYkg7Usbq":{"offered":"Fall, spring (weeks 1-7).","descr":"This course is offered to students interested in furthering their knowledge of the principles and practices of restorative justice.

The seminar will examine problems of law and how they have been addressed in Africa with particular attention to the interaction of the common law, African customary law, and other imported systems of law. Legal interaction between Africa and Europe, which began before colonial rule, intensified during the colonial period and has continued after independence. During the Colonial period, the Common Law and Civil law were imported into Africa and operated alongside customary law. The result is that pluralism of law is a common feature of legal systems in nearly all African states. The conflicts between the imported laws and customary law have generated considerable interest in reform and the integration of laws in various African countries as well as creating an opportunity to look to other legal system for alternative approaches.","offered":"Fall.","title":"Law and Social Change: Comparative Law in Africa","code":"LAW 7440","label":"LAW 7440: Law and Social Change: Comparative Law in Africa","credits":3},"NDr8PkGrtnUtUTmslznr":{"code":"COMM 1120","label":"COMM 1120: Wonder Women","credits":1,"offered":"Fall.","descr":"This course brings together students, faculty, and invited guests to discuss the art of leadership and the opportunities and challenges women in leadership roles have encountered in their careers and how they have managed them.

Discrete choice models represent the cognitive process of economic decisions and are widely used in transportation analysis, applied economics, marketing, and urban planning.

In transportation engineering, these models allow researchers, firms, and policy-makers to predict demand for new alternatives and infrastructure (e.g. a light rail or a new highway), to analyze the market impact of firm decisions (e.g. merger of two airline companies), to set pricing strategies (e.g. road pricing, toll definition, revenue management), to prioritize research and development decisions (e.g. ultra low emission vehicles) as well as to perform cost-benefit analyses of transportation projects (e.g. building a new bridge).","offered":"Fall.","title":"Microeconometrics of Discrete Choice","code":"CEE 6640","label":"CEE 6640: Microeconometrics of Discrete Choice","credits":3},"YPljGYyfmU2csFsGYUX4":{"offered":"Fall or Spring.","descr":"For study that involves both responsible participation in a community setting and reflection on that experience through discussion, reading, and writing.

Too often science is taught as a collection of static facts in a book when science professionals think of it as a highly creative and collaborative process for discovery. Many students leave science degree programs before they even have a chance to see how science really \"works,\" let alone actually participate. In this course, students will be learning about and seeing cutting-edge research in modern laboratories. Critically, they will see what the practice of science is like. The course will have three modules, each centered on the lab of a different Cornell faculty member. First, there will be a lecture by the STEM faculty member on their research that is targeted to the freshmen audience and emphasizes the importance of work, its application, and the process of discovery and exploration that is intrinsic to the research. During the ~2 weeks following the lecture, students in the course will spend a one day shadowing graduate students and post-docs in the STEM faculty member's lab. Students will write a short description of what they saw and how it relates to the broader goals of the lab they learned about from the lecture. After all students have shadowed, there will be a second meeting that includes the students, and the scientists they shadowed, and the STEM faculty member. The focus of this second meeting will be discussing the experiments they saw, how they worked, how those measurements connect to the bigger picture goals for the laboratory and the project, as well as the nature of the relationships among the graduate students, post-docs, and faculty that enable this research. Finally, students will read and critically analyze a paper from the faculty member's lab, with a third and final meeting to discuss how this final scientific product relates to the people, experiments, and process of science they saw in the lab and discussed. These activities will give students incredible insight into how science is done and its inherent excitement.","title":"Seeing Science in Action","code":"BME 1110"},"hIQSv0P2a9fM0pVgBc6B":{"label":"CS 5435: Security and Privacy Concepts in the Wild","credits":3,"descr":"This course will impart a technical and social understanding of how and why security and privacy matter, how to think adversarially, how (and how not) to design systems and products.

1955.  To study her, in a way, is to gain a deeper understanding of how she journeyed on from her days as a student here to become one of the world's greatest writers, how she has helped to transform world literature, and  how she has  shaped  Cornell's great legacy.  In this course, we will engage in close and reflective critical readings of Toni Morrison's eleven novels.  Morrison's writing style is characterized by highly distinctive strategies in the development of narrative and in the use of language.  Furthermore, from novel to novel, she is even known for developing features such as the very first sentence with great contemplation, an approach that also demonstrates her commitment to form.  As we journey across her body of work as readers, we will examine a range of recurring themes, along with the \"love trilogy\" on which she focused her repertoire for several years.  The course, through a comprehensive, chronological and focused look at Morrison's body of novels, will help students who entirely lack familiarity with it to gain a strong foundation for further research and study.  By the end of the course, even students who already know Morrison's work will walk away with a deeper and more nuanced critical understanding of it.  The course will help students to reinforce their skills in reading fiction, and help them to become more astute and exacting readers of the novel as a genre.  Morrison's novels have placed her at the vanguard of the globalization of the novel itself, and she is, undisputedly, one the most famous and innovative writers in the world.  She emerged as one of the greatest and most prolific writers of the twentieth century, and her audiences have continued to be captivated by her literary genius in this millennial age.  She is one of the most revered writers within the American literary establishment and has helped to reshape it both as a critic and novelist.  Her work can help one to develop more mastery in reading the novel as a genre.  Indeed, her thinking about this area is so original and pivotal that her fiction and critical works are absolutely indispensable for all serious students and scholars in fields such as American literature.  Its impact on African American literature is equally vital.  We will focus on reading the repertoire of novels by Morrison, including The Bluest Eye, Sula (1973), Song of Solomon (1977), Tar Baby (1981), Beloved (1987), Jazz (1992), Paradise (1998), Love (2003),  A Mercy (2008) Home (2012), and God Bless the Child (2014).  We will screen the 1998 film adaptation of her novel Beloved, along with documentaries related to Morrison such as Gail Pellet and Bill Moyers's Toni Morrison:  A Writer's Work and Gary Deans, Alan Hall and Jana Wendt's Toni Morrison: Uncensored.","title":"Toni Morrison's Novels","code":"FGSS 4509","label":"FGSS 4509: Toni Morrison's Novels"},"lteEUb3Oe51ZR5env5zV":{"offered":"Fall or Spring.","descr":"Independent

We consider the consequences epidemics have for how we live and imagine shared ecological futures.  Examining work from the life sciences, social sciences, and arts &amp; humanities, we explore the ways in which life and death, disease and survivability, health and thriving are shaped by infectious microbes, embodied eco-social forces, and contingent regimes of knowledge-power. ","offered":"Fall.","title":"What is (an) Epidemic?

Corporations engage in corporate social responsibility and social intrapreneurship, while traditional non-profits incorporate business practices in an effort to more efficiently and effectively pursue their social missions.

Through a close examination of ethnographies, intellectual histories, and religious treatises, we will analyze the key debates and discourses surrounding the intersection of gender and Islam. We begin by investigating Quranic revelations and hadith concerning gender and sexual ethics, female figures of emulation in early Islam, and feminist exegeses of the Quran. Continuing onward, we focus upon the everyday lives of Muslim women and non-binary individuals in medieval, colonial, and post-colonial contexts, highlighting the ways in which people negotiate and respond to the sexual politics of the times in which they live as we ask what, if anything, is specifically \"Islamic\" about the situations under discussion? Following this, we embark upon a history of sexuality within Islam, tracing the ways in which the categories of \"homosexuality\" and \"heterosexuality\" came to exist in the Muslim world, as well as the history and positionality of trans communities past and present. We then continue with an exploration of Islamic feminism as it exists today, looking to the ways in which Muslim feminists have critically engaged both religious texts as well as Western feminist theory.

Through a close examination of ethnographies, intellectual histories, and religious treatises, we will analyze the key debates and discourses surrounding the intersection of gender and Islam. We begin by investigating Quranic revelations and hadith concerning gender and sexual ethics, female figures of emulation in early Islam, and feminist exegeses of the Quran. Continuing onward, we focus upon the everyday lives of Muslim women and non-binary individuals in medieval, colonial, and post-colonial contexts, highlighting the ways in which people negotiate and respond to the sexual politics of the times in which they live as we ask what, if anything, is specifically \"Islamic\" about the situations under discussion? Following this, we embark upon a history of sexuality within Islam, tracing the ways in which the categories of \"homosexuality\" and \"heterosexuality\" came to exist in the Muslim world, as well as the history and positionality of trans communities past and present. We then continue with an exploration of Islamic feminism as it exists today, looking to the ways in which Muslim feminists have critically engaged both religious texts as well as Western feminist theory. Finally, the course concludes by analyzing the relationship between the study of Islam, gender, and empire.","title":"Islam and Gender","code":"FGSS 2770","label":"FGSS 2770: Islam and Gender"},"yfXBmKWUQl52PPOY5rVX":{"code":"ORIE 5300","label":"ORIE 5300: Optimization I","credits":4,"offered":"Fall.","descr":"Formulation of linear programming problems and solutions by the simplex method.

Archaeology is in a unique position to investigate these questions, and the Greek and Roman worlds offer a fruitful test ground, both because of their varied evidence, and because of their peculiar echoing in the modern world and its manifold identities.
