Historians insist that Europe invented a tradition of hating Jews and Judaism; some go so far as to argue that the destruction of European Jewry during the Holocaust was the culmination of a thousand-year-old prejudice against Jewish difference, cultivated not only by cranks and lunatics at the margins of European discourse, but by great luminaries with a reputation for progressive, even radical, opinions. In fact, the cultural problem of Jewish difference was implicated in both the destruction and the creation of European Jewry. In this seminar, we will examine exemplary works of Europe's famous anti-Jewish canon — such as Paul's letter to the Romans, Luther's \"On the Jews and their Lies,\" and Marx's \"On the Jewish Question\" — in order to contextualize a mythology of Jewish \"otherness\" that enflamed the anti-Jewish imagination even when there were few Jewish \"others\" around to hate. We will also look at critical moments in Jewish history marked by the appropriation of anti-Jewish arguments in the name of Jewish social discipline and moral authority. Through the prism of provocative Jewish texts such as the Crusade chronicles, Mendelssohn's Jerusalem and Pinsker's \"Auto-emancipation\" we will explore some of the ways in which the \"enabling violation\" of anti-semitism both constrained Jewish existence and liberated Jewish self-consciousness, turning Europe into a home for Judaism as well as a Jewish \"hell on earth.\"","offered":"Spring.","title":"Anti-Semitism and the Making of European Jewry","code":"HIST 2156","label":"HIST 2156: Anti-Semitism and the Making of European Jewry"},"56dGnjSfQML26U62XJzZ":{"offered":"Spring.","descr":"The course looks at the connection between ethics and society.  It does so by focusing on the issues raised by the phenomenon of aid, giving or receiving it, and how we understand and react to it.  We seek to make sense of aid and its place In society.  We explore the ethics of aid from the point of view of philosophy.  We move to working through the implications of aid for (1) the giver; (2) the receiver; (3) the society, local and global; (4) the relations between individuals in a given society with respect to aid and; (5) relations between one society and its members and another society when they engage in aid-related activities.","title":"Ethics and Society: Aid and Its Consequences","code":"PHIL 2941","label":"PHIL 2941: Ethics and Society: Aid and Its Consequences","credits":4},"56lwiDwD036YX9hqNMS8":{"code":"PLSCS 4030","label":"PLSCS 4030: Traditional Agriculture in Developing Nations","credits":1,"offered":"Spring.","descr":"Half the world's arable land is farmed by traditional farmers who have produced food and fiber for millennia with few outside inputs.

In high measure, censorship affects the Internet and visual media (including digital, independent cinema), and government agencies are particularly wary of the viral qualities of new media. Extensive state investment into Internet control is offset by the fact that the Internet remains a primary site of political dissent and organizing. New media and communications technologies further continue to engender novel forms of political expression and notions of collectivity. In the past few years activists and artists as well as mass publics have thus forged distinct modes of expression in and around new media that, while frequently evading state prohibition, nevertheless present incisive political critique. The course will examine features unique to digital media—such as the viral, mimetic, archival, and amplificatory properties of the Internet—and ask how politicized media make use of these features to intervene into contexts of censorship and occlusion. We will draw on Asian media contexts also to interrogate assumptions about progressive politics.

First, there will be a lecture by the STEM faculty member on their research that is targeted to the freshmen audience and emphasizes the importance of work, its application, and the process of discovery and exploration that is intrinsic to the research. During the ~2 weeks following the lecture, students in the course will spend a one day shadowing graduate students and post-docs in the STEM faculty member's lab. Students will write a short description of what they saw and how it relates to the broader goals of the lab they learned about from the lecture. After all students have shadowed, there will be a second meeting that includes the students, and the scientists they shadowed, and the STEM faculty member. The focus of this second meeting will be discussing the experiments they saw, how they worked, how those measurements connect to the bigger picture goals for the laboratory and the project, as well as the nature of the relationships among the graduate students, post-docs, and faculty that enable this research. Finally, students will read and critically analyze a paper from the faculty member's lab, with a third and final meeting to discuss how this final scientific product relates to the people, experiments, and process of science they saw in the lab and discussed.

Finally, we briefly introduce likelihood-based techniques that incorporate assumptions about the distribution of the response variable, focusing on logistic regression for binary dependent variables. Students are expected to produce a research paper built around a quantitative analysis that is suitable for presentation at a professional conference.

Currently, retailing is leading economic growth and transformation in emerging markets around the world, both through global sourcing and global marketing. In the US, retailing comprises 40% of the economy, and is the largest employer. Problems faced by retailers are shared by other firms in the economy, and retailers are often the dominant player in a supply chain.

In high measure, censorship affects the Internet and visual media (including digital, independent cinema), and government agencies are particularly wary of the viral qualities of new media. Extensive state investment into Internet control is offset by the fact that the Internet remains a primary site of political dissent and organizing. New media and communications technologies further continue to engender novel forms of political expression and notions of collectivity. In the past few years activists and artists as well as mass publics have thus forged distinct modes of expression in and around new media that, while frequently evading state prohibition, nevertheless present incisive political critique. The course will examine features unique to digital media—such as the viral, mimetic, archival, and amplificatory properties of the Internet—and ask how politicized media make use of these features to intervene into contexts of censorship and occlusion. We will draw on Asian media contexts also to interrogate assumptions about progressive politics.

The course examines how corporations respond to these environmental complexities, why they adopt different approaches to business and HR management, and whether alternative strategies affect important outcomes for firms, employees, and other stakeholders.","offered":"Spring.","title":"Globalization and Human Resource Strategies","code":"ILRHR 6616","label":"ILRHR 6616: Globalization and Human Resource Strategies","credits":4},"SbsBNuW0heVpJ7oTZqFI":{"label":"MATH 1710: Statistical Theory and Application in the Real World","credits":4,"offered":"Fall, Spring.","descr":"Introductory statistics course discussing techniques for analyzing data occurring in the real world and the mathematical and philosophical justification for these techniques.

Freud's Moses and Monotheism addresses the unconscious and intersubjective dimensions of the act that founds a people, which \"imprints\" itself on the people in ways that exceed the framework of allegiance. \"How,\" he asks of Moses, \"did one single man come to stamp his people with its definite character and determine its fate for millennia to come?\" This transmission is further remarkable in being non-linear, discontinuous, distorted by repression, skipping many generations and crossing continents, but imposing itself nonetheless. My hypothesis is that Freud's argument might shed light on one of the central problems of political theory: the status of what Rousseau calls \"the act by which a people is a people.\" The act as psychoanalysis understands it is not something we can know, interpret, or anticipate, but something by which we are \"struck\" both psychically and in the body, where it leaves its traces or impressions. What then is involved in being \"struck\" by the act of another, and how might it help us to understand the stakes of the act for those who receive it? What role do the unconscious and the body play in the subjectivation of the people and the transmission of its legacy? We will read psychoanalytic texts alongside works of political theory by Rousseau, Marx, CLR James, Du Bois, Arendt, Derrida, Rancière, Zizek, and Badiou.","title":"Psychoanalysis and Historical Transmission"},"WTOBjbPUWRp8RejmTUCA":{"credits":4,"descr":"This course continues to develop necessary skills to communicate in the Tibetan language.","offered":"Spring.","title":"Elementary Modern Tibetan II","code":"TIBET 1112","label":"TIBET 1112: Elementary Modern Tibetan II"},"WUMq9wbaB49zyItuBpF7":{"offered":"Spring.","descr":"Medicine has become the language and practice through which we address a broad range of both individual and societal complaints.

Historians insist that Europe invented a tradition of hating Jews and Judaism; some go so far as to argue that the destruction of European Jewry during the Holocaust was the culmination of a thousand-year-old prejudice against Jewish difference, cultivated not only by cranks and lunatics at the margins of European discourse, but by great luminaries with a reputation for progressive, even radical, opinions. In fact, the cultural problem of Jewish difference was implicated in both the destruction and the creation of European Jewry. In this seminar, we will examine exemplary works of Europe's famous anti-Jewish canon — such as Paul's letter to the Romans, Luther's \"On the Jews and their Lies,\" and Marx's \"On the Jewish Question\" — in order to contextualize a mythology of Jewish \"otherness\" that enflamed the anti-Jewish imagination even when there were few Jewish \"others\" around to hate.

Freud's Moses and Monotheism addresses the unconscious and intersubjective dimensions of the act that founds a people, which \"imprints\" itself on the people in ways that exceed the framework of allegiance. \"How,\" he asks of Moses, \"did one single man come to stamp his people with its definite character and determine its fate for millennia to come?\" This transmission is further remarkable in being non-linear, discontinuous, distorted by repression, skipping many generations and crossing continents, but imposing itself nonetheless. My hypothesis is that Freud's argument might shed light on one of the central problems of political theory: the status of what Rousseau calls \"the act by which a people is a people.\" The act as psychoanalysis understands it is not something we can know, interpret, or anticipate, but something by which we are \"struck\" both psychically and in the body, where it leaves its traces or impressions. What then is involved in being \"struck\" by the act of another, and how might it help us to understand the stakes of the act for those who receive it? What role do the unconscious and the body play in the subjectivation of the people and the transmission of its legacy?

Companies are highly interested in extracting knowledge from these sources. To be able to manipulate and analyze large structured and unstructured dataset, you need to learn how to code. In this course, by learning VBA (Visual Basic for Applications), you will take your Excel skills to the next level. You will learn how to design and code an algorithm and manipulate datasets. In the second part of the semester, you will learn a more advanced coding language called Python.

My hypothesis is that Freud's argument might shed light on one of the central problems of political theory: the status of what Rousseau calls \"the act by which a people is a people.\" The act as psychoanalysis understands it is not something we can know, interpret, or anticipate, but something by which we are \"struck\" both psychically and in the body, where it leaves its traces or impressions. What then is involved in being \"struck\" by the act of another, and how might it help us to understand the stakes of the act for those who receive it?

Students also occasionally develop a senior honors thesis from the research in the lab. Weekly meetings provide an opportunity for the projects featured that week to get feedback and suggestions from lab members. On occasion, we have collaborators from other universities Zoom/Skype in as well. Reading assignments are used to get background on a project and as part of the literature review that is needed to identify the project's particular contribution. However, most of a student's time will be spent actively participating in research, not just reading about previous studies. Students keep a weekly log of their activity that is submitted at the end of the semester.","title":"Social Dynamics and Computational Methods","code":"SOC 4390","label":"SOC 4390: Social Dynamics and Computational Methods","credits":4},"mpiavVQSYHkSO607cbU0":{"credits":1,"offered":"Fall, Spring.","descr":"Tired of that same old route on campus?  Come trail running!  We'll get you out on the spectacular local trails, provide training tips, teach you how to navigate in the woods, and run you over hill and dale, through forests, fields, and mudpits.  It will be a confidence-building, life-changing, attitude-adjusting experience. We'll start easy and gradually build over the duration of the course, but you should be able to run comfortably for 50 minutes. Group pace.

In the Arab world and Israel, the film industries reflect upon struggles of self-determination. The Iranian film industry underwent significant changes following the Islamic Revolution of 1979. By viewing a range of films from the Arab world, including North Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean, as well as from Turkey, Israel, and Iran, we will consider the significance of these national rubrics and how they have shaped the work of filmmakers throughout the Middle East.   Films also reach beyond the boundaries of the nation, and so, we will consider how these films transcend national borders. On the one hand we will consider limit factors, like censorship, and the role of language and dialect on film viewership and distribution. And, on the other hand, we will consider the influence of external forces, such as the influence of foreign film markets in Europe and North America on filmmakers in the Middle East, as well as the effects of foreign financing—both from Europe and the Gulf States.  All films will be screened with English subtitles.","title":"Middle Eastern Cinema"},"qYa9sI06FMROr6ICdKYQ":{"label":"LAW 7885: Legal Research Clinic","credits":1,"descr":"Approximately 15 hours of work per week.

In high measure, censorship affects the Internet and visual media (including digital, independent cinema), and government agencies are particularly wary of the viral qualities of new media. Extensive state investment into Internet control is offset by the fact that the Internet remains a primary site of political dissent and organizing. New media and communications technologies further continue to engender novel forms of political expression and notions of collectivity. In the past few years activists and artists as well as mass publics have thus forged distinct modes of expression in and around new media that, while frequently evading state prohibition, nevertheless present incisive political critique. The course will examine features unique to digital media—such as the viral, mimetic, archival, and amplificatory properties of the Internet—and ask how politicized media make use of these features to intervene into contexts of censorship and occlusion. We will draw on Asian media contexts also to interrogate assumptions about progressive politics.

In high measure, censorship affects the Internet and visual media (including digital, independent cinema), and government agencies are particularly wary of the viral qualities of new media. Extensive state investment into Internet control is offset by the fact that the Internet remains a primary site of political dissent and organizing. New media and communications technologies further continue to engender novel forms of political expression and notions of collectivity. In the past few years activists and artists as well as mass publics have thus forged distinct modes of expression in and around new media that, while frequently evading state prohibition, nevertheless present incisive political critique. The course will examine features unique to digital media—such as the viral, mimetic, archival, and amplificatory properties of the Internet—and ask how politicized media make use of these features to intervene into contexts of censorship and occlusion.

African countries promoted educational expansion with the expectation that it would lead to socio-economic development. The initial euphoria, however, was followed by skepticism and then disillusion.  Education, as it was being organized, delivered, received, and utilized, began to be perceived even as a hindrance to development. The course examines the relationship between formal education and individual and national development. Different paradigms of development, including modernization and dependency theories, and Third World Forum, are discussed with an emphasis on the perceived and actual roles of education in individual and national development. The issues to be discussed include education and schooling, the role of primary, secondary, and higher education in development, the problems of employment, language, equity in access and results with a focus on gender, race, and social class.
